# 2IMA15
2IMA15 Geometric Algorithms Jupyter Notebook

Implemented:
- DCEL Datastructure (backend module)
- Slab Decomposition Algorithm (slab_decomposition_algorithm module) 
- Vertical Decomposition Algorithm (vertical_decomposition_algorithm module)
- Jupyter Notebook about construction of these algorithms, and how it performs in practice 
 
In the graph_generation module we consider 2 function to generate some interesting graphs to try the algorithms on. 


Requirements:
- ipympl (For jupyter widget)
- networkx (For graph visualisation in jupyter)
- matplotlib (For graph visualisaton in jupyter)
- shapely ()
- numpy (For numeric operations)
