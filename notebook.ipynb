All datastructures such as the doubly-connected edge list, binary search tree, the search structure at the end, and both algorithms that we will discover, are implemented by ourselves. One is encouraged to check out the implementation in the python files, as we will not go into full detail into this notebook here. Rather we implement the modules we have written, and call revelant functions where deemed relevant, and sometimes give an impression about what the class looks like. This notebook should then still give a quite good impression already on how implementation is done. \n",

More specifically, an edge is simply a straight line segment in which it’s both endpoints are not included. These endpoints are called vertices. A face is a maximal connected subset of edges.\n",
    "The subdivision of a planar subdivision is defined as the sum of the number of vertices, edges and faces it consists of.\n",

A vertex map is maintained to get the existing vertex object for a given $(x,y)$ coordinate in constant time. Similarly we maintain a hedge map that, given an vertex, finds in constant lookup time which hedges the endpoint is the origin of, and which hedges it is the endpoint of. To do this we have created a $\\texttt{HedgesMap}$ that maintains $2$ hash maps (one for origin outgoing edges, and one for incoming edges of the endpoint vertex).\n",

The two half-edges created from the undirected input edge are called each others twin. These half-edges will hold a pointer to its twin, but also the face on its 'left' border and its origin and destination vertex, which we refer to as endpoints of the edge. Half edges also contain pointers to its previous and next half edge. These previous and next half-edges are the other edges that border the face in counter-clockwise direction.\n",

    "\n",
    "We will have a high level look of the construction of the DCEL. The $\\texttt{build-dcel}(points, segments)$ looks as follows:\n",

    "        self.__add_face_pointers()\n",
    "        self.__create_outer_face(points)\n",
    "```\n",
    " - The $\\texttt{add-points}$ functions creates vertices of the points (that will later be used as endpoints for segments) and fills the vertices hash map. \n",
    " - The $\\texttt{add-edges-and-twins}$ function creates the edges and corresponding half edges objects (with twins) and fills the corresponding $\\texttt{hedges-map}$ hashmap. \n",
    " - The $\\texttt{add-next-and-previous-pointers}$ is rather interesting. For each halfedge, it needs to be determined what it's next edge is. The technique for this works as follows: Each vertex on the plane is considered. We call $\\texttt{hedges-map.get-outgoing-hedges-clockwise(vertex)}$ to get the outgoing half edges belonging to the vertex in clockwise sorted order. Then we traverse these edges and set the next edge of the twin of outgoing half edge to the outgoing half edge that is next in the traversal. The following image should make this idea more clear.\n",
    "![title](images/clockwise_next_setting.png)\n",
    "Half edge 1, is the first outgoing half edge considered in the iteration. The twin of this half-edge (half-edge 1') will then have its $\\texttt{next}$ component point to half edge 2. This will happen until all edges are considered. It is clear that since each half-edge is an outgoing half edge for precisely one vertex, that after all vertices have been considered, that the $\\texttt{next}$ component for each half-edge has been set.\n",
    "\n",
    " - The $\\texttt{add_face_pointers}$ function creates faces for each cycle of half edges, and set the $\\texttt{incident-face}$ field for each half-edge accordingly. Furthermore the $\\texttt{outer-component}$ of the face is set to one of the half-edges.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Finally the $\\texttt{create-outer-face}$ function creates an outer face for the input graph.\n",
    "\n",
    "This datastructure allows for easy traversal of the planar subdivision. For example we can easily find all surrounding half-edges of a face by starting at the half-edge that is the outer-component of the face and continously go to next half-edge of the considered edge until we visited them all. Finding neighbouring faces can just as easily be done by inspecting what face is referenced by both twins of all the half-edge bordering a face.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we explain how we implemented the algorithms discussed in this notebook, it is important to know that we assumed general position for all graphs to be used for the algorithms implemented in this notebook. This includes that no two nodes have the same $x$-coordinate. All graphs consist of faces that are simple polygons, and there are no crossing edges. Furthermore, the graph has to be a connected graph.\n",

    "The first algorithm discussed gave a query time of $O(\\log n)$. This good query time gives some optism at first sight. Even for $n$ really large, a $O(\\log n)$ query time should be a computation that can be done quite fast in theory. Unfortunately a binary search tree is required to find the slab the query point lies in. Then, each slab needs their own binary search tree to locate between which $2$ segments of the slab the query point lies. This gives a worst case space complexity of $O(n^2)$. For $n$ really large the quadratic growth could make the storage rather problematic. Even for a relatively small number such as thousand points the quadradic factor would increase the number to $1.000.000$! It also not hard to imagine that in practice a lot of segments are needed. For example the Netherlands has very concise borders and one would need many segments to store the boundaries. This quadractic storage could also affect the runtime of the query in practice when many IO calls need to be made. Furthermore we have seen that the datastructure required a preprocessing time of $O(n^2 \\log n)$ time. For $n$ large this would probably result in a very long preprocessing time, which could be very undesirable in the application of this datastructure. It's therefore clear that it would be good if we can improve on this preprocessing time and space complexity, which brings us to the second algorithm.\n",

    "Have another look at the slab decomposition in the figure of the previous section. As one can see, we only need parts of the vertical lines that are drawn. As a matter of fact, it is sufficient to draw for each endpoint a segment 'upwards' until it hits a segment, and analogously a line downwards until it hits a segment. This division is called the Trapezoidal Map. Observe that in this Trapezoidal Map for each trapezoid, still there is no endpoint contained in it and each point has the same top and bottom segment. Therefore, all points of such trapezoid lie in the same face. The Trapezoidal Map has less trapezoids than in the slab decomposition and thereby removes a large part of the unnecessarily split up faces. As a matter of fact, the trapezoidal map has a linear number of trapezoids as we will see later.\n",

When $n$ gets larger it is much more unlickely that a poorly balanced tree pops out since the probability that the segments are in a bad order will decrease (feel free to try the code multiple times to observe that sometimes left branch of the root contains a large subtree, and sometimes it contains only a single node). This randomization technique will give us an expected size of the search structure of $O(n)$.

Furthermore, the constants are hidden and it could be that this worst case complexity is only reached in some very rare cases. In this section we will try to look a bit further than these complexities, and inspect some time/storage measures of the algorithms in practice.\n",

This sequence solves to $\\frac{n^2}{4}$ regions in total which indeed is a quadratic number of regions. It then follows that the binary search trees have $\\Theta(n^2)$ nodes in total. Furthermore construction of binary seach trees can be done in $O(\\alpha \\log \\alpha)$ where $\\alpha$ is the number of nodes. Hence it follows that we have a construction of $O(n^2 \\log n)$. \n",

One would expect, in particular on the larger input graphs, the Vertical Decomposition algorithm to outperform the Slab Decomposition algorithm since the complexity has a factor $n$ less. On the other hand both algorithms have the same query time complexity, so a similar growth should be expected there. Finally, the slab decomposition algorithm uses $O(n^2 \\log n)$ storage, whereas the vertical decomposition algorithm has an expected storage of $O(n)$.

There are many factors that could influence the actual performance in practice (number of processes running, temperature of cpu, how good randomization of vertical decomposition is, etc...). One might want to redo these tests a few times to get more confidence in the general tendency of these plots. It should however be clear that we see rather quadratic kind of growth in the construction time of the search structure of the slab decomposition. On the contrary not such a steep growth can be observed in the vertical decomposition. In particular the construction time does not grow significantly when the number of faces grows which makes the type of growth hard to determine just by means of a plot. However, when both graphs are put into the same plot, we can see a clear difference between the construction time and their corresponding growth. Indeed, vertical decomposition seems to be significantly faster."

    "Indeed! Under the context of these graphs, the storage requirement of slab decomposition grows linearly. This is as expected since every slab is intersected by a constant number of segments, and converseley the number of slabs a segment intersect is also constant. We now have that the binary search tree of a single slab has a size requirement of $O(1)$. The binary search tree containing all slabs still has size $O(n)$, which gives us a total size requirement of $O(n)$. An interesting observation is that the constant in the linear storage requirement for slab decomposition seems to be smaller than the constant in the linear storage requirement for vertical decomposition."

    "In practice it is not hard to imagine that segments would overlap many slabs. Consider for example the border of countries, that are bordering many other countries. Then also take into account how concise these border fragments actually are. It therefore seems likely that in practice Slab Decomposition would actually act more quadratic both in construction and storage as we have seen in the first analysis. Therefore we think that Vertical Decomposition would for most cases be the most desirable option."
